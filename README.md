# Keyboard-Auto-Suggestion-NLP-Python-Project
Overview

Keyword Autosuggestion Project is an advanced proof-of-concept system built in Python for generating real-time keyword auto-suggestions via NLP techniques. It integrates interactive notebooks for exploratory prototyping, a modular Python backend (`app.py`), and a lightweight front-end (`index.html`) to deliver suggestions with low latency.

 Architecture & Components

1. Exploratory Notebooks
- `Autocorrect with Python How It Works.ipynb`  
  Provides a conceptual foundation of auto-correction, including orthographic distance metrics (e.g. Levenshtein), probabilistic ranking, and demonstration of real-time correction logic.
  
- words suggestions.ipynb  
  Showcases linguistic preprocessing pipelines and suggestion generation flow: normalization, tokenization, stop-word removal, frequency analysis, edit-distance candidate generation, and scoring.

2. Suggestion Engine (`app.py`)
A production-ready Python module implementing:
- A search space of candidate keywords loaded from `autocorrect book.txt`, which serves as the dictionary or lexicon.
- Preprocessing pipeline:
  - Normalization (lowercasing, accent stripping, Unicode normalization)
  - Tokenization and optional stemming or lemmatization
- Candidate generation methods:
  - Edit-distance based transformations (insertion, deletion, substitution, transposition)
  - N-gram frequency matching with approximate lookup
- Ranking mechanism:
  - Weighted scoring combining string proximity (e.g., Damerau–Levenshtein distance) and corpus frequency
  - Configurable scoring weights to balance relevance vs. closeness
- Interface/API:
  - Exposes suggestion logic as REST-like endpoints (via Flask/FastAPI, if applicable) or CLI interface for integration with other systems.

3.Frontend Interface (`index.html`)
A minimalist HTML/JavaScript client:
- Accepts user input in real-time
- Sends queries to backend suggestion engine (via AJAX or form submission)
- Dynamically displays ranked suggestions
- Designed for demonstration, easily extensible into SPA frameworks (e.g., React, Vue
Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Recommended packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `flask` or `fastapi`, `python-Levenshtein`, `jupyter`

Installation & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GChandanaKeerthi/KeywordAutosuggestionProject.git
cd KeywordAutosuggestionProject
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # create this as needed

Usage Modes
1. Exploratory Mode
Launch notebooks with:
jupyter notebook
Follow interactive walkthroughs in Markdown and code cells.
2. Local Web Server Mode
Run the backend locally:
python app.py
Access via browser at http://localhost:5000 (or the configured port). Use index.html to interactively test suggestions.
3. Command-Line Mode (if supported)
Execute a query directly:
python app.py --query "exmple"
Returns suggestions in terminal output (JSON or plain text).________________________________________

Algorithmic Details
●	Levenshtein / Damerau–Levenshtein Distance

 Efficient C-accelerated implementations (e.g. python-Levenshtein) compute minimal edit operations to generate candidate suggestions.

●	Frequency-Guided Ranking

 Candidate keywords are ranked using a scoring function:

score = α × (1 / (1 + edit_distance)) + β × (frequency_norm)
●	where α, β are tunable hyperparameters.

●	Optimization & Scaling

○	Precompute edit-distance neighbor maps for common prefixes.

○	Use Tries or BK-Trees for efficient nearest-neighbor retrieval.

○	Batch-processing logic for handling simultaneous queries.

●	Extensibility

○	Expand lexicon via external corpora (e.g. n-gram datasets, query logs).

○	Integrate contextual embeddings (e.g. Word2Vec, BERT) for semantic suggestion enhancement.

○	Extend to multilingual support with Unicode-aware normalization.

Best Practices & Conventions
●	Follow PEP-8 formatting and module naming conventions.

●	Document algorithms with docstrings, including time/space complexity.

●	Use unit tests (e.g. via pytest) for critical functions (e.g. edit-distance, ranking).

●	Modularize components—backend, ranking logic, lexicon loading, preprocessing—for maintainability.

●	Enable configuration via CLI flags or a config.yaml:

○	Paths (lexicon file, data directory)

○	Weights (α, β)

○	Backend server settings (host, port)

Future Enhancements
●	WebSocket Interface for low-latency, continuous suggestion streaming.

●	Cache & Memoization Layer: Accelerate frequent queries using LRU caches or Redis.

●	A/B Testing Harness: Measure performance/quality with real users.

●	Metrics Dashboard: Logging/visualization of suggestion quality, response times, algorithm effectiveness.

●	Continuous Lexicon Updates: Automatic ingestion of new keyword sources or search trends.
